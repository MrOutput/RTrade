A single request for multiple data items, such as a call to the Get Quote API that includes 25
different stock symbols as parameters, is treated as a single request.

Get Quote
Returns detailed market information for securities.

This API returns detailed quote information for one or more specified securities. An optional flag
specifies one of five pre-configured field sets to return: fundamentals, intraday activity, options,
a 52-week display, or all available details (the default). Developers can select the response that
most closely fits their needs to minimize data size, processing time, and network traffic.
Version v0 of the E*TRADE API supports real-time market data (as opposed to delayed data,
available in some other contexts). Users who have not yet signed the real-time market data
agreement on the E*TRADE website receive an error message when trying to access market
data with this API.
